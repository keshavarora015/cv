   <h3> A Fuzzy logic based efficient routing strategy for an ad hoc cognitive radio network </h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
     Due to exponential growth in the number of wireless devices which are on exchanging huge amount of data, requirement
     for the spectrum in almost all bands has risen very sharply. The availability of the spectrum is limited and its
     demand is monotonically increasing the proposed routing scheme is basedon Fuzzy logic with increased value of QoS
     parameters are provided as input to the rule based expert system that it infers optimal path as output.
